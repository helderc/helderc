### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Helder, an educator, researcher and developer with a background in computer science and medical imaging based in Calgary, Canada. 
I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, a Ph.D. and a Master's in Biomedical Engineering, where I worked with digital mammography and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis, leveraging computational techniques to advance breast cancer detection. Recently, Iâ€™ve broadened my research to explore innovative approaches to student engagement and open educational resources.
