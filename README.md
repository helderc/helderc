### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Helder, a Postoctoral Fellow at the University of Calgary (UofC), Canada. I have PhD and Masters in Electrical Engineering where I worked with medical images (digital mammography and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis). At the UofC I'm working with Bayesian networks, Time-series processing and Granger causality.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: R language and Bayesian data analysis.
