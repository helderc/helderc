### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Helder, an instructor at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT), in Calgary, Canada. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Ph.D. and Masters in Electrical Engineering where I worked with medical images (digital mammography and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis). 

As a researcher, I'm interested in medical images mainly for the detection/diagnosis of breast cancer. However, I'm also interested in all types of clinical data analysis towards helping people.
